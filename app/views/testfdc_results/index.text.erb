This document contains a listing of mainboards and floppy controllers that
have been tested with Dave Dunfield's TESTFDC program. His registry seems to 
be in an unmaintaned state, so we've put this one together to try and keep the
registry updated. As with Dave's original registry, there is no guarantee that
this information is correct.

----------------------------- Useful  Information ----------------------------

All mainboards should pass the 'D' tests - these are required for standard PC
formats.

A mainboard that fails all 'S' tests will not be able to read or recreate
single-density disks, which account for a significant portion of older non-
PC formats.

A mainboard that passes the 250 and 500kpbs 'S' tests, but fails the 300kbps
'S' test will not be able to handle single-density with a 1.2M 5.25" HD drive
(the most common 5.25" drive types in AT and later machines), however it will
be able to do it if you install a DD drive. (Use of a DD drive is recommended
for SD/DD formats anyway, even if the HD setup supports it).

The 'X' test (Double-Density with 128 bytes sectors) checks a capability that
is used by very few disk formats, and for most people, not having it will not
be a significant drawback. (Which is good, because the original NEC-765 PC
controller, and most later chips based on this design don't support it).
